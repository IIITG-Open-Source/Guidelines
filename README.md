# Guidelines
1. Choose a project you want to work on and ask the **coordinators** for the same. If the project **does not** have the required count of active members then you will be permitted to contribute to the project.
2. You can also present your own idea for the technical board to the **coordinators** and if it gets approved it will be added to the organization.
3. Every project has some tasks that are supposed to be done within the specified **deadlines**, these deadlines will be decided by the **coordinators** after discussing with the team working on the project.
4. Every project should have proper documentation and a readme.md file, as many different people will be working on the same project even after the completion of your own version.
Going beyond the assigned deadline will result in a **warning** and a **final submission date**, not following through the final submission date will result in you being **removed** as a contributor.
5. **Respect and take help** from your teammates and seniors who have already worked or are working on your current project.
6. Commits should have **meaningful summaries** of the changes.
7. **Do not** commit **large changes** like a major feature addition in a **single commit.**
8. **Do not** push too many commits in a **single push**, always push commits as soon as possible.
9. **Always** pull before doing a push, so as to **not overwrite** any changes made by a teammate.
10. **Comments and issues** will be given on **commits and pushes** by the **organization managers**, you are allowed to discuss them with the manager on the commit or push comments until resolved. These are expected to be **incorporated** into further revised versions of the changes, **ignoring any necessary reviews will not be tolerated.**
11. **Do not** use the main branch for all commits, the main branch should only be used to deploy the project as the current stable release.
12. Every project should have a **dev** branch from main which will have the **most recent** changes on the project.
13. Always make a **new branch from dev** for a version change or major feature update and merge the branch to dev on completion, so as to not hinder the working of other parts of the projects.
14. **Use proper** naming and file structure conventions as per the tech stacks used.
15. If any backend is **not involved**, host it on **GitHub pages** else, we will be providing **Heroku dynos** in future for the same.
16. **Do not** take up these projects to the IIITG administration on your **own accord.** This can **only** be done by the **Technical Board Secretary.** Any actions taken by the college for individual misbehavior will **not be handled by us.**
17. Only the **Technical Board Secretary** can **create or delete projects**, and **add or remove members** from the organization.
18. Coordinators can only **add or remove members to/from projects.**
19. The managers of the organization will **not be taking part** in making any changes to any projects. They are only responsible for **maintaining** the projects.
20. In case of any dispute **Technical Board Secretary** has the last say.
21. **Long term** inactivity will result in you being **removed** from the organization.
